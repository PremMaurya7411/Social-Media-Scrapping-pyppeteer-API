# Setup Instructions

## Installation

### Python Installation Process
Before proceeding, ensure Python is installed on your system. If not, you can download and install Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### Setting up a Virtual Environment
To work with Django, it's recommended to create a virtual environment. Follow the steps outlined in the [Python documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html) or use tools like `virtualenv` or `venv`.

### Installing Django
Once the virtual environment is set up, you can install Django within it. Refer to the [Django documentation](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/stable/intro/install/) for detailed instructions on installing Django.
